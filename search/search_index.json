Most used Adapters are: ioBroker.ping : Ping configured IPs ioBroker.backitup : Handles backup of ioBroker and Homematic installations ioBroker.tr-064 : Integrate AVM FritzBox into ioBroker ioBroker.alexa2 : Control Amazon Alexa/Echo devices Adapters can be developed and added to ioBroker by everyone. Development basics ioBroker is based on NodeJS. This runtime environment is available for different plattforms like Linux, Windows and MacOS. The programming language is JavaScript. Also TypeScript can be used, which enhances JavaScript with functions like classes. The greatest benefit is extending JavaScript by adding types, which results in better code with fewer runtime errors.","title":"Developing Adapters for ioBroker"},{"location":"#developing-adapters-for-iobroker","text":"","title":"Developing Adapters for ioBroker"},{"location":"#concept-of-iobroker","text":"ioBroker is open source and based on an open concept.
